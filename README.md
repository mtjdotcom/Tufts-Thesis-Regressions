The paper outlined the use case for bitcoin as a medium of exchange for remittance transfers. How the world’s 232 million migrants send money home is primarily handled by money transfer agents. However, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could provide faster, cheaper transfers across borders by disintermediating traditional financial institutions. This analysis found that middle-income countries with internet-literate populations stood to benefit the most from cryptocurrencies. The enclosed regression analysis attempted to demonstrate that remittances can to some extent explain bitcoin’s use in middle-income countries (e.g., model 1 suggested that a 1% increase in remittances leads to a 0.83% increase in core bitcoin software downloads). Nevertheless, cryptocurrencies are still nascent technologies that continue to face adoption hurdles and ongoing technical issues. Cryptocurrencies have the potential to unleash a new era of value transfer across the Internet if these hurdles and technical problems are solved.
